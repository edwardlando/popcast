    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Last Updated: July 24, 2014
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Eiffel Tower LLC and our subsidiaries (collectively, "Popcast")
    when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with
    us.
</p>
<p>
    We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some
    cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites' homepages or sending you a notification). We encourage you to
    review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Collection of Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, use the Services to send or receive
    messages, including photos or videos taken via our Services (“Popcasts”), request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of
    information we may collect include your username, password, email address, phone number, age and any other information you choose to provide.
</p>
<p>
    When you send or receive messages, we also temporarily collect, process and store the contents of those messages (such as photos, videos, and captions) on
    our servers. The contents of those messages are also temporarily stored on the devices of recipients, for a period of 24 hours. Once 24 hours have passed,
    we automatically delete the Popcast from our servers and our Services are programmed to delete the Popcast from the Popcast app on the recipients' devices.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, we cannot guarantee that deletion of any message always occurs within a particular timeframe. We also cannot prevent others from making
    copies of your messages (e.g., by taking a screenshot). In addition, as for any other digital information, there may be ways to access messages while still
    in temporary storage on recipients' devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted. You should not use Popcast to send messages if you want to be
    certain that the recipient cannot keep a copy.
</p>
